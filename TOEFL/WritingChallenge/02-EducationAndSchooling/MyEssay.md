### Essay:

Since the advent of university-based pedagogical systems around the world, many studies have been carried out about success at universities and its root causes. Providing a universally-acceptable contributing factor to success, from college tutors to family and friends, seems infeasible. However, I believe that university professors play a pivotal role in this respect, which is discussed hereunder.

Pedagogy experts are of this prevailing opinion that, including various contributing factors, teachers have the most significant influence on the students' success. More than it can be assessed,  university tutors have a considerable impact on the students' career and life. Besides the core courses and set texts of the field, teachers can transfer technical qualifications and soft skills to the students, such as creativity, problem-solving, perseverance, and time management; therein lies the opportunity for the students to apply their new knowledge and information in their career. Moreover, teaching techniques have undergone remarkable improvements in the past decades. Conducting practical workshops instead of only teacher-led lectures is one of the most useful ways that tutors can apply to achieve their goals. As a result, tutors can keep the students on track, interested in the field, and thirsty for knowledge, by harnessing new scientific teaching approaches, which leads the students to success.

Furthermore, universities, in denotation and connotation, are created to transfer knowledge and techniques to the students. To fullfill  this duty, guided learning has been being exploited to support the knowledge assimilation of the pupils. Without proper supervision, students' concentration would waver, and their attention to the materials would wander plausibly. Thus, it is vital that teachers be supportive of their students by providing them advantageous feedbacks should they desire to pave their way of achieving success. On the other hand, using supervised learning, students can prevent re-inventing the wheel in every issue they confront, thereby keeping their focus on the learning process. As a consequence, students can put more effort into their studies and seek their goals, whether they be gifted children or not. 

In conclusion, there are a couple of factors to students' success, neither of which, I believe, is as important as the university tutors. Teachers, more than others, possess the ability to support students in resolving their difficulties and problems. Although, to achieve this goal, a teacher's effort has to be vigorous in its scope and energy, and exceptional in its aspiration.
