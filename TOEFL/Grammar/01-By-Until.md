### By, Until, By the time, no ... than
---

These sentences are different:

> - I'll be at the office until noon.
> - I'll be at the office by noon.

1. By, at/on or before => a finite action
2. Until and to => a coninued action/state

> - I'll be at the office until noon. (*be* means stay)
> - I'll be at the office by noon. (*be* means arrive)  

> - I'll finish my homework until 5. **wrong**. until -> by (finite action)
> - I'll finish my homework at 5. **right**
> - I'll work on my homework until 5. **right**

#### By/Until - can be used with all tenses except perfects, in which we use *by*

> - I'll have completed my tasks by 5.
> By the time he arrived, she had already left. (`by the time` is an adjective clause)

1. by the time + adjectvie clause:
> - She waited in the lobby until he arrived. (`until he arrived` is an adverb clause)

2. use until to creat adverb clause:
> - Until he arrives, she can/will wait in the lobby. 

**- `By` cannot be used like `until` to make adverb clauses.**
**- `By` is always a preposition. `Until` can be a prepostion or a conjunction for an adverb clause**.

3. `no later than` and `no earlier than` are another options:
> - I'll be done by 7 => I'll be done no later than 7.
> - I'll be there no earlier than noon. => I won't be there by noon. (watch out the negation)
> - I'll be there at noon. => I won't be there until noon.

> `No later than` and `no earlier than` are used like maximizer or minimizer.
