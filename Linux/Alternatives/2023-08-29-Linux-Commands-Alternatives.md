Some linux commands and their alternatives that I use

For most of them, it's easier to create aliases.

1. `dust` instead of `du`

See how to install it, [here](https://github.com/bootandy/dust).

It's very informative!

2. `tldr` instead of `man`

The purpose of TLDR (Too Long, Didn't Read!) is to show examples of using various commands.
On Ubuntu it will be installed with `sudo apt install tldr`

3. `bat` or `batcat` instead of `cat`

See [here](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) to find how to install it.

4. `exa` instead of `ls`

Check out its [website](https://the.exa.website/).
`exa` is especially useful when you want to see the directory tree.

8. `ack` instead of `grep`
