(If you are already familiar with `tmux`, and you are looking for a simple `.tmux.conf`, go to the end of this post.)

It's been a long time since I wanted to start using `tmux` to see how it could be helpful, but Honestly, I haven't felt the need to use it until just recently, when I had to run a long-running process on a remote server, and I didn't want to keep my terminal open all the time. So, I decided to give `tmux` a try. And I'm glad I did! It's a powerful tool that can help you manage multiple terminal sessions in a single window, and more. Here are some tips and tricks that I found useful.

For getting started, you can check tmux [official documentation](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Getting-Started). Also, this one is a good [cheat sheet](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/). For the *aweseome* list of `tmux` resources, you can check [this](https://github.com/rothgar/awesome-tmux).

## About `tmux`

`tmux` is a terminal multiplexer that allows you to run multiple terminal sessions in a single window. It's similar to `screen`, but it has some additional features that make it more powerful and easier to use. With `tmux`, you can create multiple windows and panes, detach from a session and reattach later, and share sessions with other users.

`tmux` handles everything by a server-client model. The server runs in the background and manages all the sessions, windows, and panes. The client is the terminal that you interact with. You can have multiple clients connected to the same server.

To install `tmux` on your system:

```bash
# Ubuntu
sudo apt install tmux
```

## Using tmux basics

I have provided some basic commands in this section, but in the following sections, I have provided the shortcuts and commands that you can use inside `tmux`. Also, I skipped writing about `tmux commands` in the status bar (similar to `vim` commands). If you want to see those, visit the cheat sheet I mentioned above. However, you can enter `tmux` command mode by pressing `Ctrl+b :`.

One useful command is `: set mouse on` to enable the mouse in `tmux`. You can enable it for all the sessions by adding `-g` to the command. (`tmux set -g mouse on`). To disable mouse, you can use `: set mouse off`.

Ok, back to the basics:

- List all sessions with `tmux ls`
- Start a new session with a name: `tmux new -s mySession`
- Attach to a session:

```bash
tmux attach -t mySession
# or short
tmux a -t mySession
# Attach to the last session
tmux a
```

- Detach from a session running `tmux detach` or pressing `Ctrl+b d` in the session.
- Kill a session with `tmux kill-session -t mySession`.

## Inside tmux

All commands in `tmux` start with `Ctrl+b` followed by another key (Unless the prefix key is changed in the configuration file). To see the full list of commands, you can press `Ctrl+b` followed by `?`. The documents use the format `C-b <command>` to represent the `Ctrl+b` key combination. Also, `M-<key>` represents the `Alt+<key>` combination, and `S-<key>` shows the `Shift+<key>` combination.

## Customizing tmux

One of the beauties of `tmux` is that you can customize it very easily. You can create a `.tmux.conf` file in your home directory and add your custom configurations, from changing the default key bindings to setting the colors of the status bar. Here is a simple `.tmux.conf` file:

```bash
# Set the prefix key to Ctrl+a -> people usually use this key binding
set -g prefix C-a
unbind C-b
bind C-a send-prefix

# Start windows and panes at 1, not 0
# Why you ask?! because 0 is pretty far away on the keyboard
set -g base-index 1
setw -g pane-base-index 1

# Enable mouse support
set -g mouse on

# Set the status bar colors
set -g status-bg black
set -g status-fg white

# Set the splitting commands, | for horizontal and - for vertical
bind | split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind - split-window -v -c "#{pane_current_path}"
unbind '"'
unbind %

# open new windows in the current path
bind c new-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"

# reload config file
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf

# Use Alt-arrow keys without prefix key to switch panes
bind -n M-Left select-pane -L
bind -n M-Right select-pane -R
bind -n M-Up select-pane -U
bind -n M-Down select-pane -D

# set default terminal mode to 256 colors
set -g default-terminal "xterm-256color"
set -ga terminal-overrides ",xterm-256color:Tc"

# Visual bell, no sounds
set -g visual-bell on
set -g bell-action none
```

### Managing tmux windows and sessions

**After** updating the `.tmux.conf` file, follow the table below:

| Command        | Description                   |

| `Ctrl+a w`     | List all windows              |
| `Ctrl+a w 0-9` | Switch to window 0-9          |
| `Ctrl+a c`     | Create a new window           |
| `Ctrl+a &`     | Close the current window      |

| `Ctrl+a p`     | Move to the previous window   |
| `Ctrl+a ,`     | Rename the current window     |

## Automatic Startup

You can start `tmux` automatically when you open a terminal. To do this, add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```bash
# Start tmux if not already running
if [ -z "$TMUX" ]; then
    tmux attach || tmux new
fi
```

If you want to start `tmux` with a specific session, you can use the following command:

```bash
# Start tmux with a specific session
if [ -z "$TMUX" ]; then
    tmux attach -t mySession || tmux new -s mySession
fi
```

To save a session when you exit `tmux`, you can use the following command:
