# Lesson 11 - Health and Sickness

Having put a couple of kilos, I decided to make a couple of lifestyle changes to improve my overall health. There is a general consensus that if one can quit smoking, reduce daily stress, eat a balanced diet, get plenty of sleep, and exercise regularly, he can increase his life expectancy.
Furthermore, I tried to get vaccinations to prevent special diseases, and have health insurance to unpredicted situation. Although I do not suffer minor or serious injuries thankfully, I might experience a car accident. In the case of a broken or fractured bone, I have but to put that bone in a cast.
Suffering from a chronic condition is the condition I cannot stand at all. Even a minor ailment can make you lose your temper if it continues for a long time, let alone more serious conditions. One of my friend has had a chronic stomachache for a long time. No matter what he has done, from taking aspirin to prescription medication, it could not help alleviate the symptoms. It has driven him crazy. The last thing that the doctors told him was that he is diagnosed with a more serious illness in which the acidic water in his stomach keeps going up and causes the disturbing pain. And if it continues like this, and he does not make a change in his diet sooner, he may be terminally ill. I hope that he changes his diet as well as his mind!
