# Lesson 03 - Relationships

I believe, when it comes to appearance, Iranian girls have the upper hand over the other Middle Eastern ones. They usually have an **hourglass figure** with a **slender waist**, and with the help of plastic surgery, most of them maintain **upturned noses**. Sometimes, they perform such operations on their body that one could say they **bear a striking resemblance to** famous singers and models.
Iranian women usually have **sleek, jet-black hair** in contrast with their peers in European countries, who possess blond hair. Although European girls generally have **pale blue or green eyes**, Iranian ones have brown or black eyes.
I found it quite strange, but it seems accurate that **absolutely gorgeous** girls are usually with the most **hideously ugly** guys. I do not know what makes them loveable, their **unkempt hair, ruddy complexion, or deep-set eyes**. Hardly could I believe my ears, when one of my classmates told me that she finds **facial hair** somewhat attractive. Not only does she likes huge **shaggy beard** but also she prefers **bushy eyebrows**. I cannot understand how she can stand **thick mustache**. Gross!
Thankfully, it is not all about body hair. It seems that **athletic bodies**, as well as **muscular arms**, catch the imagination of the girls. I hope these men find combing their hair more amusing than **sporting curly hair**.
