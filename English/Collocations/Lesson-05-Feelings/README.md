# Lesson 05 - Feelings

During the time I was doing my military services, I experienced a **roller coaster of emotions**. From **seething with anger** to being **deeply depressed**, I could do nothing but **bottle up my emotions**. It seemed the people I had to cope with were from a different planet. They had no understanding of the value of time. It did not matter how much I try to talk them into understanding another person situation, but I just got **increasingly anxious** over time. During the last months, I was **visibly disappointed** with those people. To put it in another way, I had missed my close friends, and even I became **deeply depressed** that I do not communicate with them very often. Therefore, being an **emotional wreck**, I decided to confront the problem and tried to reunite with my old friends. Although we were not really in touch at that time, everything went smoothly, and I was **blissfully happy**. I cannot express enough how I was **pleasantly surprised** at the effect of keeping in touch with my old friends. The person who might **lose his temper** because of the military environment was turned into a **peacefully calm** one. I was **worried sick** that I could not change my behavior forever, but fortunately, that was then when my friends came to the rescue. I am **immensely grateful** to all of my friends, and sometimes I am **overwhelmed with emotion** as I reflect on how lucky I was to have my friends and family beside me at that time.
