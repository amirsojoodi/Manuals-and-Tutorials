# Lesson 03 - Relationships

My wife and I are thinking about migrating to another country in which we can continue our higher educations. Considering migration, we are already frightened about where we can stay in another country, knowing nobody. Admittedly, we will not be able to **have a place of our own** at first. We may search for a **short-term rental** apartment, or maybe **a studio apartment** with one big room because we cannot share the apartment with anyone. We have to lower our expectations while looking for a new house. Therefore, a house with a balcony **overlooking the ocean**, **a nice view of the skyline**, or a **spacious living room** is not on the table because it is not affordable. We have to start saving up for a **down payment** from our very first salary because I hate **taking out a mortgage** from a bank and **paying it off** during a lifetime. Hopefully, with a great deal of effort, we may **afford a spacious house** from **upscale neighborhoods**. If that happens, after we move into the new place, we will **throw a housewarming party**, and invite all of our friends who let us stay at theirs over the past decades!
