# Lesson 08 - Movies and Books

As far as I can recall, I have never been into movie theaters; however, I have seen a couple of remarkable performances while I was at them. To put it in other words, I usually download movies and watch them on my laptop! In spite of not being a **huge fan of films**, I have a close friend who is a movie enthusiast. He always reserves the best seats on **opening nights**, though sometimes he sells some of them in the black market! Unbelievably, he has already written and directed some fantastic short movies, some of which are based on **true stories** from different countries.
Although I have never **been engrossed in** film critics' reviews, I always enjoy imagining myself to star as the **leading role** of a **box-office hit** while I am daydreaming! Well, it sounds childish but I, deep inside, admire being praised and respected. I think, more or less, it is quite common to have these psychological attachments. Even though it seems simple and straightforward, there are a couple of remarkably exciting and **enjoyable reads** about this **controversial topic**. For instance, I borrowed one of them from our neighborhood library last year, of which I have read the **opening chapter**. It was concise, rich and skillfully written. As I did not finish the book last time, to complete its **closing chapters**, I maybe borrow it again.
