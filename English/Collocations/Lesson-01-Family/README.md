# Lesson 01 - Family

I am Amir, and I was born in **a loving family** 27 years ago with three persons as my **immediate family**. Since my childhood, we were not really into our **extended family** because we have lived in a far city from our **distant relatives'** hometown. Like many other children in this generation, I had a **carefree childhood**, and fortunately, our **relations were not unhealthy**. On the contrary, I can remember our neighbors, who had a **dysfunctional family** and their children had a **troubled childhood**. I am not sure what happened to them after all, but I assume they eventually went through a **bitter divorce** or even a **messy divorce**.
Moreover, they had a lot of conflicts during the **divorce settlement**, and eventually, they were nothing but a **broken home**. Being separated, the mother and the father kept fighting over the **custody of their children**, and I've heard that the judge **grant joint custody** to them. Not only have not they **stayed on good terms** with each other but also they ruined their children childhood. Anyway, I am not sure how to divert these situations with my wife, but it is essential for both the wife and the husband that they be understanding and supportive of each other. Sometimes my wife and I consider having a child, but the difficulties of being pregnant tempt us to think about **adopting a child** from a **single mother**. I hope the child will not try to find its **birth mother** one day!
