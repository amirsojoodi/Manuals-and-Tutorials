# Lesson 01 - Family

Considering myself **musically gifted**, I regret not continuing my career as a musician. I have always could play without looking at **sheet music**. Although I have not composed any complete songs, I can play **catchy tunes**. When I look back at all those leisure times that I have wasted, I get filled with nothing but regret. A couple of my friends, in contrast, have followed their **natural talent for music** and become a professional band. Written many **song lyrics**, they have even released their **debut album** a year ago, and wait for their **big break** to get their feet in the door of the music industry. It has to be mentioned that becoming successful comes with a price for them, too. Not only have they **played gigs** at bars and clubs for years, but they have also remixed a lot of favorite tracks to be able to produce something deserves of becoming a **missive hit**.
Moreover, they are going to go on tour around the country to play live at their concerts. They are famous for their contemporary genre, but lately, they have released some **instrumental rock** tracks, and their **cult followers** did not mind that at all. I hope, someday soon, they become heroes with a **sizable following** around the globe.
