# Lesson 04 - Character and Behavior

Since the advent of the information era, nobody has written an essay with all these collocations together that I am going to write! Not that I am **painfully shy**, but hardly have I had a **vivid imagination**, when it comes to writing.
Although my friends usually address me as a guy with a **good sense of humor**, my colleagues complain a lot about how I have **hurt their feelings** with my being **brutally honest**. It is not my fault that they have **low self-esteem**. One has to **develop a thicker skin**, when they are around a person who is **fiercely loyal** to the truth, and **speaks his mind**. My coworkers should **come out of their shells**, and **show their true colors** and do not gossip behind each other's back. This behavior would only result in chaos in which everyone **bears a grudge against** one another. Only when they put aside their **tendency to be arrogant**, can they **put others first**. Thus, instead of **playing pranks on** their colleagues in front of their bosses, people should work on their **superiority complexes**. And trust me! When you get over with **swallowing your pride**, it gets easier not to show your **competitive streak**!
