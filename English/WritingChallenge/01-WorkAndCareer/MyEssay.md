## Essay

Modern life has brought a wide variety of job opportunities to the Societies whereby people can seek their suitable jobs more liberally than the past. This variety, however, raises a discussion that although people have now more extensive options, their choice of a career has become more challenging to make. While some people are of the opinion that young people should stick to a single career, I believe, it is acceptable for some other groups of juveniles to be welcoming of career changes. The analyzing of the reasons behind this debate, which includes job satisfaction and improving soft skills, will be conducted hereunder.

Talent and experience are woven into the very fabric of career success. On the one hand, experiences are achievable in nature, and, by drawing a feasible plan,  younger people can climb the career ladder eventually. Whether a menial job or a skilled one, workers can make improvements and carve a niche for themselves. On the other hand, however, this effort can be questioned by the possible inconsistency of the workers' skills with their current job. To put in another word, that would be more fruitful, if the workers' expertise overlaps with their current job requirements. In this situation, not only do they achieve better career progression, but they also enjoy becoming more productive. This enjoyment, indeed, leads to better job satisfaction which is in itself an excellent, motivating factor that causes their progression to be even more remarkable.

Furthermore, switching between careers helps people to improve their soft skills such as creativity, resilience, and being a good team player. According to some of the job agencies, there will be stiff competition between job seekers in the coming future, and the winners are the ones who exhibit an excellent grasp of the mentioned strengths. These strengths are the direct product of experiencing various job atmospheres and mostly gained through exposure to changing jobs frequently. Thus, it can be claimed that not until people master these skills, will they be ready to have a promising career. So, should younger people aspire a crowning achievement, they have but to be open to new opportunities.

In conclusion, while some young people stick to only one career during their lifetime, some others prefer to try different careers to find their dream jobs. Despite the drawbacks of changing career, I believe that experiencing various work atmospheres eventualy helps workforces to achieve job satisfaction and more benefitial soft skills.
