There are several things to consider when releasing a binary. Here are some tips that I found useful.

## Best Practices

1. Releases are tied to **tags**, not branches.
2. Versioning - Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)!
3. Security - Sign the binaries and verify the signatures.
4. Changelog - Keep a [CHANGELOG.md](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) file.
5. License - Include a [LICENSE](https://choosealicense.com/) file.
6. Documentation - Include a README.md file including how to install and use the binary.
7. CI/CD - Automate the build, test, and the release process.

## Consider Signing the Binary

Signing the binary is a good practice to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the binary. You can use GPG on Linux:

```bash
# If you don't already have a GPG key, generate one:
$ gpg --full-generate-key
# Choose RSA and a key size (e.g., 4096).
# Set an expiration date (or none for permanent).
# Enter your name and email (match your GitHub email).
```

Then, export the public key:

```bash
$ gpg --armor --export YOUR_EMAIL > public.key
# This will create a file named public.key.
```

After that, sign the binary:

```bash
$ gpg --detach-sign --armor app-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
# a file named app-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.asc will be created.

gpg --detach-sign --armor app-windows-x64.zip
# a file named app-windows-x64.zip.asc will be created.
```

Then, you can upload the binaries and their signatures to GitHub releases.

- app-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
- app-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.asc
- app-windows-x64.zip
- app-windows-x64.zip.asc

Then, users can verify the binaries using the public key:

```bash
$ gpg --import public.key
$ gpg --verify app-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.asc app-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
$ gpg --verify app-windows-x64.zip.asc app-windows-x64.zip
# output should be sth like: "Good signature from YOUR_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL>"
```

## Automating the Release Process with GitHub Actions

Add a GitHub Action workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`).

```yaml
name: Release Binaries

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'  # Triggers on versioned tags like v1.0.0

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up build environment
        run: echo "Setting up..."

      - name: Build
        run: |
          # Replace with your build commands
          echo "Building binary for ${{ matrix.os }}"

      - name: Upload binaries
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: app-${{ matrix.os }}
          path: path/to/binary

  release:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Download artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./artifacts

      - name: Create GitHub Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
        with:
          files: ./artifacts/**
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref_name }}
```

### Automating the Signing in GitHub Actions

You can automate the signing process using GitHub Actions. Here is an example workflow:

```yaml
- name: Import GPG Key
  run: |
    echo "$GPG_PRIVATE_KEY" | gpg --batch --import
    echo "trusted-key $(gpg --list-keys --with-colons | grep pub | cut -d: -f5)" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf

- name: Sign Binary
  run: gpg --detach-sign --armor myapp-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

### Alternative to GPG

If you're distributing via containers or want an alternative to GPG, you can use [Sigstore Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign).

### Code Signing for Windows

I haven't done this myself, but you can sign the Windows binaries using [SignTool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/signtool).
