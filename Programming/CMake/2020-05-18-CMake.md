Using pip, it's pretty straightforward:

```bash
pip install cmake
```

In a sample project create the CMakeLists.txt, something like this:

```bash
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5.1)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)

project(HelloCmake)

add_executable(HelloCmake src/main.cpp src/vect_add_one.cpp src/increment_and_sum.cpp)
```

Then move the build directory and run:

```bash
cmake ..
```

If you are using Git bash in Windows with MinGW toolchain, run this:

```bash
cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" ..
```

Followed by `make`.

## Another straightforward option to make life easier

Set this alias in ~/.bashrc :

```bash
alias cmake='cmake --no-warn-unused-cli -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS:BOOL=TRUE -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug "-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER:FILEPATH=C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-8.1.0-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0\mingw64\bin\gcc.exe" "-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:FILEPATH=C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-8.1.0-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0\mingw64\bin\g++.exe" -G "Unix Makefiles"'
```

Remember to replace the paths with the correct ones.

## Useful functions

For full documentation, see [here](https://cmake.org/documentation/).

| Function | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| `configure_file(file.in file.in COPYONLY)` | Copy a file from the source directory to the destination directory (build). It's useful for copying input files and config files. |
| `set(srcs file1.c file2.c ...)` | Creates a variable (e.g. src), and assigns something to it (e.g. the list file1.c file2.c). To clear a variable, do not provide second argument, e.g. set(srcs). |
| `include_directories(dir1 dir2 ...)` | Adds the provided directory paths to the compilers list of directories that it will search for include files in, for any following targets. |
| `add_library(name STATIC/SHARED/MODULE file1.c file2.c ...)` | Adds a library target that will be build from the provided source files. __DO NOT APPEND__ lib to the name (this is done automatically by cmake depending on architecture). |
| `add_executable(name file1.c file2.c ...)` | Adds an executable target (as opposed to a library target). |
| `link_libraries(lib_1 lib_2 ...)` | Links the provided libraries to all following targets in the CMakeLists.txt file. This is deprecated. It is recommended you use target_link_libraries() instead. |
| `target_link_libraries(target_lib other_lib_1 other_lib_2 ...)` | Links the provided libraries to the specific target library. link_libraries() can be used to apply to libraries to all following targets (i.e. no specific target is provided), however, it is deprecated. |
| `install(TARGETS targets...)` | Used to place build output into certain directories on the user's system (as well as do things like assign privileges to these files). |

## Test the project executables with CTest

In the Cmake file, add the following lines:

```bash
include(CTest)

add_test(NAME validate COMMAND ${PROJECT_NAME})
set_tests_properties(validate PROPERTIES PROCESSOR_AFFINITY ON PROCESSORS 4)
```

Then, after running `cmake ..` and `make` in the build directory, run this:

```bash
cmake -T memcheck -VV
# -VV means verbose
```

If you have valgrind installed, this command runs your test(s) and valgrind's memcheck on your project.
