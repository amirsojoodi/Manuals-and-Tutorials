(Tested on Power systems with RHEL8)

Problem with different toolchain and unsupported driver can be resolved through [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html)
With this feature, users can access some of new GPU features on their current systems without having the admins update the GPU drivers.

- Download and extract the compatibility files from the current version of NVIDIA Driver for V100
(Get the link from NVIDIA Driver Download [page](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/))

```bash
cd ~

wget https://us.download.nvidia.com/tesla/470.82.01/nvidia-driver-local-repo-rhel8-470.82.01-1.0-1.ppc64le.rpm
mkdir nvidia-driver
mv nvidia-driver-local-repo-rhel8-470.82.01-1.0-1.ppc64le.rpm nvidia-driver
cd nvidia-driver

# Extract rpm file
rpm2cpio nvidia-driver-local-repo-rhel8-470.82.01-1.0-1.ppc64le.rpm | cpio -idv
mkdir compat
mv var/nvidia-driver-local-repo-rhel8-470.82.01/cuda-compat-11-4-470.82.01-1.ppc64le.rpm compat
cd compat
rpm2cpio cuda-compat-11-4-470.82.01-1.ppc64le.rpm | cpio -idv

```

```bash
# Now the compatibility files should be in this path:
$ ls ~/nvidia-driver/compat/usr/local/cuda-11.4/compat

libcuda.so  libcuda.so.1  libcuda.so.470.82.01  libnvidia-ptxjitcompiler.so.1  libnvidia-ptxjitcompiler.so.470.82.01
```

Set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point to this folder before build. Now it should be fine.

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/nvidia-driver/compat/usr/local/cuda-11.4/compat/
```
