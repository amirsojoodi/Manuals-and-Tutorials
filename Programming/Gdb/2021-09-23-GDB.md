First steps:

1. Compile with proper flags: `-g`
2. (Optional) Turn off code optimization: `-O0`

## Debugging

1. Run gdb with the program not passing its arguments in this step: `gdb ./example`
2. After executing gdb, you can start the program with **run** command (with any needed arguments)
3. You can run the gdb with the `-tui` flag to see the code while debugging.

- Take a look at the GDB cheatsheet [here](https://amirsojoodi.github.io/files/GDB-Cheat-Sheet.pdf).

## Debugging MPI applications with GDB

If you have xserver running (use [VCXSRV or Xming](https://amirsojoodi.github.io/posts/Run-applications-remotely-with-GUI/) on windows for ssh), compile your code with `-g` and debug it with:

```bash
mpirun -np 2 xterm -e gdb <application>
```

More information at [OpenMPI FAQ.](https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=debugging)

## Inspecting the core file

If the program crashes with _Segmentation fault_ message, it is sometimes helpful to
increase the maximum core file size to save the in-memory state of the program at the time it crashes.

```bash
$ ./example
Segmentation fault
$ ulimit -c 2048
$ ./example
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
$ gdb ./example <corefile>
```
