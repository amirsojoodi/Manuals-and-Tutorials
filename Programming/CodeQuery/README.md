### HOW TO USE CODEQUERY WITH C/C++ CODE?
Change directory to the base folder of your source code like this:
```
cd ~/projects/myproject/src

```
Create a cscope.files file with all the C/C++ source files listed in it. Files with inline assembly code should be excluded from this list.
```
find . -iname "*.c"    > ./cscope.files
find . -iname "*.cpp" >> ./cscope.files
find . -iname "*.cxx" >> ./cscope.files
find . -iname "*.cc " >> ./cscope.files
find . -iname "*.h"   >> ./cscope.files
find . -iname "*.hpp" >> ./cscope.files
find . -iname "*.hxx" >> ./cscope.files
find . -iname "*.hh " >> ./cscope.files
```

Create a cscope database like this (add k, if you donâ€™t want standard include paths like for stdio.h):
```
cscope -cb
```

Create a ctags database like this.
```
ctags --fields=+i -n -L ./cscope.files
```

Run cqmakedb to create a CodeQuery database out of the cscope and ctags databases, like this:
```
cqmakedb -s ./myproject.db -c ./cscope.out -t ./tags -p
```

Open myproject.db using the CodeQuery GUI tool by running the following. Wild card search (\* and ?) supported if Exact Match is switched off. Or use cqsearch, the CLI-version of CodeQuery (type cqsearch -h for more info).

```
codequery
```
Use `cqmakedb -h` to get help on cqmakedb command line arguments.
