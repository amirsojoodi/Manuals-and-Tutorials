This is an unofficial LaTeX template for PhD Dissertation (Jan 2026) at Queen's University, ECE department, PPRL group.

You can use this template as a starting point for your own dissertation. It includes the basic structure and formatting required by the university, as well as some additional features such as a glossary and macros for common terms.

View it on [Github](https://github.com/amirsojoodi/Queensu-PhD-Thesis-Template) or [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/pdcwwrgtjfvy#423f0e).

- The glossary is created automatically. See the sample to understand how to define new terms and use them in the text.
- Several macros have been defined in preamble.sty to make the text more readable. Use the same format to create your own macros.
- To build locally, I suggest Linux or WSL, with `latexmk` and `makeglossaries`.
