I have created a template for Comprehensive Exam report that was submitted to the ECE department at Queen's University. It may be used for other types of documents in the same category (thesis, proposal, etc.)

Download from [here](https://amirsojoodi.github.io/files/Report-LaTeX-template.zip) or access on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mpbnjnhzbpwb) (readonly).

Some points about this document:

- The glossary is created automatically. See the text to understand how to use the glossary.
- Most of the packages are imported in `preamble.sty`
- I have defined several macros in `preamble.sty` to make the text more readable. Use the same format to create your own macros.
- You need `latexmk` and `makeglossaries` to build the PDF locally.

Good luck! ;)
